## Abstract
Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-based generation. However, achieving sufficient diversityâ€”particularly within semantically similar promptsâ€”remains a critical challenge. Prior methods use diversity metrics as guidance signals, but often neglect prompt awareness or computational scalability.

In this work, we propose **SPARKE**: _Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score_. SPARKE leverages **conditional entropy** to guide the sampling process with respect to prompt-localized diversity. By employing **Conditional Latent RKE Score Guidance**, we reduce the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, enabling efficient large-scale generation. We integrate SPARKE into several popular diffusion pipelines and demonstrate improved diversity without additional inference overhead.
